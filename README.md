# ComputerVoiceRecognition
 This is a computer voice recognition program I created in python, kinda like Alexa but way simpler.
 Feel free to use my code.
 
 Current features:
 
 only responds if you say "computer" before you say a command
 
 Open google
 
 Open youtube
 
 Search google
 
 Search youtube
 
 Wikipedia: ask "what is ___" and it will search on wikipedia for answers
 
 Time: ask "what time is it" and it will say the current time based on your computer.

If you need a tutorial on how to make one yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWvsXxDtEkU

A more complex version of mine (has way more features): https://github.com/codemaster102/Jarvis

To use this download a python code editor. I recommend PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
